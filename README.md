==============

AskYourGovt, where we plan to build a comprehensive database of Public Interest RTI requests and responses. The idea is not just to aggregate the responses. It’s to build a community around “Questioning the Govt” which includes asking more questions, demanding answers, commenting on the responses, building stories and larger public awareness.
